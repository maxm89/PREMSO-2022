    "## Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Names should be descriptive, i.e. they should resemble the functionality of a piece of code accurately. When writing your own functions and classes, please stick to the following conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Function names start with a lowercase letter, words are seperated by underscores, e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def gmx_mkbox_homogeneous():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Class names are CamelCase and start with an uppercase letter, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class GmxEquilibrationNVT:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Functions and classes that are specific to a simulation engine should start with one of the following abbreviations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Program | Abbreviation |\n",
    "|---------|--------------|\n",
    "|Gromacs|gmx|\n",

    "|GAMESS|gam|\n",
    "|NAMD|nmd|\n",
    "|QChem|qch|\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Local variables and function parameters are lowercase and seperated by underscores, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def gmx_mkbox_homogeneous(input_structure, input_topology, nmol, box_size):\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "## Comments\n",
    "1) Use comments wisely. Do not overload your code with comments, but do not use them too sparingly, either. **If the code speaks for itself, comments are not required.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use python's docstrings to comment modules, functions and classes. Describe accurately\n",
    "\n",
    "-  what a function or class does,\n",
    "-  which arguments it takes,\n",
    "-  what it returns, and\n",
    "-  what exceptions could be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use Google-style documentation [(you can make this the default in PyCharm)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-integrated-tools.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few tricks Google-style Documentation:\n",
    "Python uses Sphinx (with nbsphinx sphinx_click) to automatically generate the API's documentation.\n",
    "To rebuild the documentation, you can use the python script \n",
    "*coffe/docs/update_docs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tricks and hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Reference other functions/classes/methods:\n",
    "To reference another function's documentation, use\n",
    "```\n",
    ":func:`~coffe.core.decorators.args_from_configfile` \n",
    "```\n",
    "To reference classes, methods, and modules, use `:class:`, `:meth:`, and `:mod:`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Careful with decorators:\n",
    "If you write decorators, use functools.wraps, as in coffe.core.decorators.args_from_configfile. Otherwise, they hide the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "##### A bad (useless) comment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# initialize i\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Good commenting style:\n"
