History
-------

COFFE was initiated by Andreas Krämer in the group of Dirk Reith
at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Sankt Augustin, Germany,
in 2017.

COFFE's concept and vision were equally contributed (in alphabetical order)
by Karl N. Kirschner, Andreas Krämer, Dirk Reith and Martin R. Schenk.

COFFE is a natural progression of the work done by Dirk Reith's group at
Fraunhofer SCAI (2008-2012) and BRSU (2012-present) and builds upon the
experiences gained in developing the following tools:

* Wolf₂Pack_ (Lead development: Karl N. Kirschner)
* GROW_/ SpaGrOW_ (Lead development: Marco Hülsmann)
* CoSMoS_ (Lead development: Andreas Krämer)

.. _Wolf₂Pack: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2011.05.018
.. _GROW: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2009.10.024
.. _SpaGrOW: https://doi.org/10.3390/e15093640
.. _CoSMoS: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2014.08.022

As of April 2018, we are in the process of adding lots of functionality that
can be used in conjunction to AMBER, GROMACS, GAMESS and PSI4, as well as
basic files like PDB, XYZ and CSV formatted files. Never-the-less, we are
confident that the present version of the code will help other researchers in
automating molecular simulations and optimizing force-field parameters. COFFE
does not replace Wolf₂Pack, GROW/SpaGrOW, or CoSMoS.
